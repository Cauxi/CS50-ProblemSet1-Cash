<p>This is my solution to the CS50 "Cash" problem set, implemented in C. You can find the full problem description <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/psets/1/cash/">here</a>.</p>
Problem Overview
<p>The task in this problem set is to write a program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user change. The program takes a dollar amount as input and outputs the fewest number of coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) required to make up that amount.</p> <p>This problem set was completed as part of <strong>CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</strong>. Uploading my solution to GitHub is done in line with CS50’s academic honesty policy. For more clarification, you can refer to this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/63235w/is_this_reasonable/">Reddit thread</a>.</p>
Program Structure
<ul> <li><strong>Input Validation</strong>: Ensuring that the user provides a positive float number for the amount of change.</li> <li><strong>Coin Calculation</strong>: Breaking down the input into the fewest number of coins by repeatedly subtracting the largest coin denominations possible.</li> <li><strong>Output</strong>: Displaying the total number of coins used to make the change.</li> </ul>
Key Steps:
<ol> <li><strong>Prompt for Input</strong>: The program prompts the user to enter the amount of change owed.</li> <li><strong>Convert to Cents</strong>: The input (in dollars) is converted into cents to avoid floating-point precision issues.</li> <li><strong>Calculate Coins</strong>: The program calculates the fewest coins needed, prioritizing larger denominations (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies).</li> <li><strong>Print Result</strong>: The program outputs the total number of coins required to make the change.</li> </ol> <p>Note: This repository does not contain any files that were part of CS50’s provided libraries or sample inputs, such as the Makefile.</p>
